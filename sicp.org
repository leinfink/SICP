- primitive expressions
- means of combination
- means of abstraction

- procedures
- data
  
*** 1.1.1 Expressions
- /primitive expressions/ can get combined into combinations with operators and operands
- the value of a combination is obtained by /applying/ the procedure that is the value of the operator  to the arguments that are the values of the operands
- Lisp: /prefix notation/, allows for an aribtrary number of arguments and for easy nesting
  
*** 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
- /names/ identify /variables/ whose /value/ is a computational object
- these associations are stored in the /environment/
  
*** 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations
- general evaluation rule (for combinations) :: 1. /Evaluate/ the subexpressions of the combination. 2. /Apply/ the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpression.
  - recursive, tree accumulation
- values of primitive expressions:
  - numerals: the number they name
  - built-in operators: the respective machine instruction sequences
  - other names: the objects associated with the names in the environment
- special forms :: (combined) expressions that have special evaluation rules
  - e.g. =(define)= does not apply a procedure to its arguments, but associates a variable with a value
    
*** 1.1.4 Compound Procedures
- procedure definitions :: associating names (in the corresponding environment) with compound procedures
- general form of a procedure definition (in Scheme):
  - =(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)=
  
*** 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
- application rule for primitive procedures: built into the interpreter
- /apply/ / application rule for compound procedures :: to apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument
  - so-called /substitution model/ for procedure application
  - that is, a simplified /model/, not usually literally what happens inside an interpreter
  - for instance, instead of literally replacing the formal parameters with the arguments, a /local environment/ is used
- applicative-order evaluation :: evaluate first the operator and operands, the apply the resulting procedure to the resulting arguments
- normal-order evaluation :: evaluate the operator, but don't immediately evaluate the operands. instead, substitute operand expressions for parameters, then evaluate operators as needed until you reach expressions involving only primitive operators, only then evaluate the operands
- Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation: simpler, avoids multiple evalutions, but has some limitations (e.g. for "infinite" /streams/)

*** 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates
- /case analysis/ in Lisp: =cond=
- predicates :: procedures that return true or false, expressions that evaluate to true or false

#+RESULTS:

=(test 0 (p))= would loop indefinitely in applicative-order evaluation (as in Scheme), because the argument gets evaluated when the function is called, not only once it's used in the body. In normal-oder evaluation, y would never get evaluated because the if-condition is true. =test= would return 0.

*** 1.1.8 Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions
- local names :: the names of the procedure's formal parameters should not matter to the user of the procedure
- bound variable :: a formal parameter of a procedure, have the body of the procedure as their /scope/
- free variable :: a variable that is not bound by the procedure definition
- /block structure/ :: nesting of definitions within definitions to hide them from external use
- lexical scoping :: free variables in a procedure refer to bindings made by enclosing procedure definitions -> they get looked up in the environment in which the procedure was defined (not in the environment in which it was called, as in dynamic scoping)

- recursive process :: builds up a chain of /deferred operations/, requires space to keep track of the deferred operations
- linear recursive process :: recursive process where the amount of space neeed to keep track of the deferred operations grows linearly with /n/ / is proportional to /n/, as does the amount of steps required
- iterative process :: the state is encapsulated at all times in a fixed number of /state variables/, plus a description of update behaviors, and termination condition. space requirement is fixed.
- linear iterative process :: iterative process where the number of steps grows lineraly with /n/

- A recursive /process/ is not the same as a recursive /procedure/. =factorial-iterative= has a recursive procedure definition, but the process it generates is iterative.
- To allow for iterative processes to be generated by recursive procedure definitions, an implementation needs to be /tail-recursive/ (special iteration constructs can then be omitted).

*** 1.2.3 Orders of Growth
- n :: parameter that measures the size of the problem
- R(n) :: the amount of resources the process requires for a problem of size /n/
- R(n) = Î(f(n)) if there are positive constants /k1/ and /k2/ independent of /n/ such that $k1f(n) <= R(n) <= k2f(n)$ for any sufficiently large value of /n/ :: R(n) has order of growth Î(f(n))

In other words: For any big /n/, the resources needed will be between $k1 * f(n)$  and $k2 * f(n)$ some two positive constants /k1/ and /k2/. It doesn't matter what these positive constants are, but they have to exist. But this means that for all the processes for which /R(n) = Î(f(n))/ holds for $f(n) = n$, the same holds for $f(n) = c * n$, where c is some constant factor. That is, all processes with an order of growth of /f(n)/ also have order of growth of /f(c*n)/, that is, the two functions describe the same group of processes, so we can probably reduce it just to $f(n) = n$, or Î(n).

- orders of growth provide only a crude description of the behavior of a process (and processes with the same order of growth can still require vastly different amounts of resources)
- but they are useful to indicate how changing the size of the problem would change the resource use of the process

- Î(n) :: linear process, doubling n will roughly double the amount of resources
- Î(n^2) :: expontential process, incrementing n will multiply resources by a constant factor
- Î(log(n)) :: logarithmic process, doubling n will increase resources by a constant amount

1. =p= is applied 5 times when =(sine 12.15)= is evaluated.
2. To get the order of growth in time for =(sine a)= relative to /a/, we first note that the recursive call to =sine= is the thing that will be relevant, as both =cube= and =p= just use a constant amount of steps for each call. =sine= is called as often as is needed to repeatedly divide /angle/ by 3.0 until it (or its absolute value) is smaller or equal to 0.1. So if we triple /angle/, we will need one more step, so the order of growth is $log_3(n)$. Same goes for order of growth in space, as every call to =p= is deferred until a small enough angle is reached.

Computing $b^2n$  with =fast-expt= only needs one more multiplication than computing $b^n$. Every new step allows for (roughly) double the problem size. Therefore, its order of growth is the logarithm of /n/ to the base 2, Î(log n). The base to which logarithms are taken does not matter (because of the arbitrary constants /k1/ and /k2/), so we just write Î(log n). [ TODO: I don't think I understand that last sentence yet.

=b2: (bp + aq) * p + (bq + aq + ap) * q=

Which is equal to:

=a2:  b(q^2 + 2pq) + a(p^2 + q^2) +  a(q^2 + 2pq)==
=b2:  b(p^2 + q^2) + a(q^2 + 2pq)==

So it can be expressed as another transformation T with

=p' : p^2 + q^2=
=q' : q^2 + 2pq=

*** 1.2.6 Example: Testing for Primality

Finding the smallest integral divisor greater than 1 of /n/ (if it's /n/, then /n/ is prime):

#+begin_src scheme :exports both
  (define (divides? a b) (= (remainder b a) 0))

  (define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
    (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
          ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
          (else (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1)))))

  (define (smallest-divisor n)
    (find-divisor n 2))

  (define (prime? n)
    (= n (smallest-divisor n)))

  (prime? 29)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ;=> #t

This algorithm checks all numbers between 1 and =(sqrt n)=, so it has order of growth Î(ân). It only has to check up to =(sqrt n)=, because if /d/ is a divisor of /n/, then /n/d/ is as well, but it's not possible for both of them to be bigger than =(sqrt n)= (that would be higher than =(expt (sqrt n) 2)=, so higher than /n/). (So, any divisors bigger than =(sqrt n)= already get "caught" via their smaller counterpart.)

The Fermat Test:

- Fermat's Little Theorem :: If /n/ is a prime number and /a/ is any positive integer less than /n/, then /a/ raised to the /n/-th power is congurent to /a/ modulo /n/ (= has the same remainder as /a/ when divided by /n/).

  /In general/ (but not always!), non-prime /n/ will not satisfy this theorem. From this, we can devise a /probabilistic/ algorithm to test for primality, by checking more and more random integers smaller than /n/ for alignment with Fermat's Little Theorem.

  First, computing the exponential of a number modulo another number (using successive squaring):

  #+begin_src scheme :exports both 
    (define (expmod base exp m)
      (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
            ((even? exp) (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) m))
            (else (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m))))

    (expmod 2 4 9)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : ;=> 7

The fermat test now takes a random number /a/ between 1 and /n/-1 and check if the /n/-th power of /a/ modulo /n/ is /a/.

#+begin_src scheme :exports both
  (define (fermat-test n)
    (define (try-it a)
      (= (expmod a n n) a))
    (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ;=> #<void>

Now, we can run this as often as we want, to get more and more sure of our answer about the primality of n:

#+begin_src scheme :exports both 
  (define (fast-prime? n times)
    (cond ((= times 0) #t)
          ((fermat-test n) (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))
          (else #f)))

  (fast-prime? 87083 100)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ;=> #t

This algorithm is /probabilisitic/. While failing the Fermat test is a /certain/ indication that /n/ is not prime, passing our algorithm makes this not certain, but only very probable. What's more, there are some very few numbers (/Carmichael numbers/) that fully fool the Fermat test, they are not prime but satisfy Fermat's relation (so even if we test /all/ integers smaller than /n/, we can still not be sure.) But there are some alternative algorithms that fix this, so that the probability really increases with every additional check.

My 10,000 area primes seem to have taken around as long as predicted. (But the times vary a lot for each re-evaluation on my system, sometimes it doesn't match at all and can, for example, take up to 2 times longer than expected.) Note that the timings will be updated every time I reevaluate the buffer with /org-babel/, but my manual calculation here is fixed to a rough time I took once.

For the 100,000 area primes the times seem to match the prediction quite well (and pretty stably so), relative to the 10,000 times.

Is my result compatible with the notion that programs on my machine run in time proportional to the number of steps required for the computation? I guess this holds true for large number of steps, wiht low number of steps there is sometimes a mismatch, maybe caused by some constant overhead? But then why does that result in a doubling of the expected times?

The modification halved the number of steps. Time varies significantly for each re-evaluation on my system, I don't know why. This makes conclusions hard. But for the 1000 area primes, the modification appears to have made it 4 times faster (but sometimes not). For 10,000 area primes, the time got roughly halved (sometimes not). For 100,000 area primes, there is sometimes no noticeable benefit, but sometimes it even goes to around 4 to 5 times faster! So yeah, uncertain conclusion, certainly no simple ratio.

I would expect primes around a million to take about twice as long as primes around 1000, going from 10 to 1000 and going from 1000 to a million both involves an exponentiation to the power of 3, and =fast-prime?= has a logarithmic order of growth.  In fact, it even seems to take a bit less than twice as long.

**** DONE Exercise 1.25
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2023-01-13 Fri 18:35]
If we were to replace =expmod= with a version that simply computes the remainder of =fast-expt=, we would experience a drop in performance. Both versions use successive squaring, but the "trick" in =expmod= allows us to get the remainder without ever computing numbers much higher than m.
**** DONE Exercise 1.26
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2023-01-13 Fri 18:41]
When we use =square=, applicative-order evaluation allows us to calculate =(expmod base (/ exp2 ) m)= only once in the successive-squaring step, whereas Lois Reasoner's version has to calculate it twice each time.  As these are recursive calls, this multiplies for every additional step k (2*2*2*2...), reaching 2^k. As we need log(n) steps, this amounts to 2^(log(n)), which is n (assuming log base 2, which we can do, as base doesn't matter for order of growth), so the order of growth in time of the process is Î(n).

*** 1.3.2 Constructing Procedures Using =lambda=
- =lambda= to make a procedure
- =define= for a function definition is just like lambda, except it gives the function a name
- lambda can also be used to create local variables, which is simplified by the sugar =let= (but really we just need lambda)

Computational elements with the fewest restrictions on how they can be manipulated have /first-class/ status (coined by Chistropher Strachey).

- they may be named by variables
- they may be passed as arguments to procedures
- they may be returned as the results of procedures
- they may be included in data structures

  Lisp procedures have first-class status.
