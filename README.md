# SICP
My solutions to the exercises in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (Abelson and Sussman 1996 [1985]). I am reading the second edition, in this nicely typeset version: [SICP-PDF](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf).

I am using *Chez Scheme* (version 9.5.8) and *org-babel* with *geiser* for literate programming. This repo is just for myself for purposes of documentation and motivation, but if you notice any mistakes, please feel free to tell me!

Current progress up to exercise: **1.12**
