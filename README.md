# SICP
My solutions to the exercises in *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (Abelson and Sussman 1996 [1985]).
I am using MIT Scheme (release 11.2). This repo is just for myself for purposes of documentation and motivation, but if you notice any mistakes, please feel free to tell me!

I am reading the second edition, in this nicely typeset version: [SICP-PDF](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf).

Current progress up to exercise: **1.12**
